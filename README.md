Spring MVC Demo
===============

I have created a Spring MVC demo application to showcase the elegance and functionality of the framework.  It is a simple application that utilizes Spring MVC 4 + Spring Data JPA + jQuery UI as well as many other useful technologies.

If interested, please see the [Spring MVC Demo Page](http://chrisbaileydeveloper.com/projects/springmvc/) on my website where I showcase the application.

## Steps to set up development environment in Eclipse ##
1. **Download** or clone the project from GitHub.  
2. Navigate to the project directory and run the following from the command line:
  
    `$ mvn package`

3.	Open Eclipse in order to import the project.
4.	File -> Import -> Maven -> **Existing Maven Projects** (Navigate to folder and import)  

5.	Right click your project, click Run as -> **Run on server** (Supposing you already have a Tomcat server setup locally)
