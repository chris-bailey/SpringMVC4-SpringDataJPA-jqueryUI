# Spring MVC Demo


I have created a Spring MVC demo application to showcase the elegance and functionality of the framework.  It is a simple application that utilizes Spring MVC 4 + Spring Data JPA + jQuery UI as well as many other useful technologies.


## Steps to set up development environment in Eclipse ##
1. Clone the project from GitHub.  
2. Navigate to the project directory and run the following from the command line:
  
    `$ mvn package`

3.	Open Eclipse in order to import the project.
4.	File -> Import -> Maven -> **Existing Maven Projects** (Navigate to folder and import)  

5.	Right click your project, click Run as -> **Run on server** (Supposing you already have a Tomcat server setup locally)  

6.  Navigate to the following URL to access the application:  **http://localhost:8080/springmvc-demo**
